# Description

This group of applications will act as a platform for local ticket sales. Both vendors and customers need an account to use our platform. Our Webservice saves passwords encrypted in an Oracle database. A vendor can create a Ticket and an Indoor map of a building using spatial, so the customer knows where he can grab his ticket in the specified building (For example if a vendor owns a shop in Atrio Villach he can create a brief map of the Atrio and add the location of his shop, so the customer knows where he needs to go). A customer pays via platform integrated money in the Android app, and the vendor receives the money on his platform integrated wallet. Checks if the customer has enough money to pay for the ticket(s) are made using database triggers. All transactions are saved in a table so vendors and customers can see which transactions they made in the past. The Android App lets the user purchase tickets. The Java App enables the vendor to manage his tickets. The C# App will visualize the indoor map of the users bought tickets. All the applications communicate using a Glassfish server implementing REST webservices.
